# Asteroids-Project

Version 5.1

* Scoring is implemented
* multiple lives and respawning are implemented
* asteroids of three sizes are implemented
* game-pausing(press 'p') and game over states are implemented
* you can switch ships with 's' key
* you can switch backgrounds under menu

TODO:

* General polish

Known bugs: 0 (see issues tab)

Things to improve upon:

* Asteroids only move diagonally for now
* Bullet spawn position (AKA where on the ship they are fired from)

Things to consider:
* Should the ship's velocity be added to that of the bullet's?
